# VeChain DeFi Projects

Welcome to VeChain's new **community-driven** DeFi space!

## Phase #1

During this phase we fork the Uniswap-v2 and make a basic DEX on VeChain.
Developers are welcomed to **utilize** this organization's open source code to deploye their own DEXs.

- `uni-v2`: Uniswap-v2 fork of contracts.
- `vvet`: WETH style VET escrow contract.
- `uni-v2-deploy-scripts`: Deploy tools for `uni-v2` and `vvet`.
- `uni-v2-interface`: Demo web user interface for `uni-v2`.
- `uni-v2-vechain-test`: Additional tests for uniswap-v2 on VeChain.

## Phase #2 (On-going)

This phase deals with several targets:

- Incentive Token design guidelines for DEX. (For specific projects to consider)
- Cross-chain bridge to port USDT from Ethereum to VeChain.
- Same as above, but in reversed direction, port vVET to Ethereum.
